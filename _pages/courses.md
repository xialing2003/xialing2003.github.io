* APC 524 / MAE 506 / AST 506 / CSE 524
[course link](https://henryiii.github.io/se-for-sci/content/intro.html)

  This course teaches basic tools and principles of writing good code, in the context of scientific computing. It contains using git, pytest, logging, debugging, building packages, and mixing languages.

* Modern Statistics
[course link](https://sml505.pmelchior.net/Introduction.html)

  This course is about building models to explain the observed data, and improving models based on error analysis. 

  Sections 1 and 2 on the basics of probabilistic modeling including linear regression     
  Sections 3.1 for Bayesian models       
  Section 4 - 4.2 for error propagation and parameter uncertainties           
  Section 9 for MCMC inference        

* Statistical Foundations of Data Science
[textbook link](https://fan.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf5476/files/documents/chapters1-3.pdf)
[course link](http://fan.princeton.edu/525.html)

  A theoretical introduction to statistical machine learning for data science. It covers multiple regression, kernel learning, sparse regression, high dimensional statistics, sure independent screening, generalized linear models, covariance learning, factor models, principal component analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and related topics such as community detection, item ranking, and matrix completion.These methods are illustrated using real world data sets and manipulation of the statistical software R.

* COS513: Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling
  [course link](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos513/#sec-1)
  
  This course covers fundamental topics in probabilistic modeling, an important area of machine learning research. We learn how to model data and develop algorithms to learn the structure underlying these data for the purpose of prediction and decision-making. We cover several model classes--conditional and unconditional models--and several inference algorithms, including variational inference, the algorithm behind variational auto-encoders. At the end of the course, students should be well-equipped to come up with a probabilistic model and inference algorithm for their data, and use the fitted model for tasks of interest.

* ECE 533/MAE 575 Data Assimilation
    
  This course covers the theory and numerical algorithms of nonlinear filtering and smoothing, starting with the discrete-time linear Gaussian case and advancing through the general continuous-time nonlinear non-Gaussian case. Variants of Kalman and ensemble methods will be covered with derivations and sketches of important proofs. A review of the necessary elements from probability and stochastic processes is included. Following the theory, numerical algorithms are regularly demonstrated on a suite of problems that include aerospace and geoscience applications.
