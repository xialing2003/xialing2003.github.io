* Modern Statistics
[course link](https://sml505.pmelchior.net/Introduction.html)

  This course is about building models to explain the observed data, and improving models based on error analysis. 

Sections 1 and 2 on the basics of probabilistic modeling including linear regression     
Sections 3.1 for Bayesian models       
Section 4 - 4.2 for error propagation and parameter uncertainties           
Section 9 for MCMC inference        

* Statistical Foundations of Data Science

  A theoretical introduction to statistical machine learning for data science. It covers multiple regression, kernel learning, sparse regression, high dimensional statistics, sure independent screening, generalized linear models, covariance learning, factor models, principal component analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and related topics such as community detection, item ranking, and matrix completion.These methods are illustrated using real world data sets and manipulation of the statistical software R.
